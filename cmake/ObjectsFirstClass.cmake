# When linking OBJECTS -> OBJECTS -> LIB/EXE, the "contents" from the first OBJECT are not propagated to the
# final target. This is apparently by design to avoid accidentally linking the same OBJECT multiple times.
# A workaround for this was found in the link below, is entails using custom functions that "...record object
# lists in a custom target property and then use target_sources() to add the list to the first non-object
# library...". However "a clear drawback of this approach is that the order in which libraries are linked
# becomes important."

    # Accumulate LINKED_OBJECTS until reaching a non-object target, and add them as
    #   extra sources - this will de-duplicate the list and link it into the target.
